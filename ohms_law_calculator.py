'''Exercise 2: Ohmâ€™s Law Calculator
Instructions:
1.	Ask the user what they want to calculate: Voltage, Current, or Resistance.
2.	Based on their choice, prompt the user to input the appropriate values.
3.	Use Ohm's Law to calculate the missing variable and display the result.
4.	Handle cases where division by zero might occur.
